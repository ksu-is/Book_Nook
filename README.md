# Book_Nook
I am creating a program for book lovers. In this program you will be able to keep track of your current reads, past reads, and future "tbr". You can add various information such as genre and reading status. There will be an option to update any information which makes updating your reading status and book rating easy!

This project is going to be done using tkinter and python. It is very user friendly and easy to learn.
